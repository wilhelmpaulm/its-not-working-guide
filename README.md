Questions to guide me when "it's not working".

----

## When you're editing something and it's not reflecting:
### did you . . .
- [ ] save the file before reloading the server/browser?
- [ ] confirm all the files were updated? 

----

## When you're creating a merge request:
### did you . . .
- [ ] rebase to the main branch?
