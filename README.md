Questions to guide me when "it's not working".

----

## When you're editing something and it's not reflecting:
### did you . . .
- [ ] save the file before reloading the server/browser?
- [ ] confirm all the files were updated?

----

## When you start to get frustrated:
### remember . . .
- [ ] refreshing the page multiple times in a row will not change anything
- [ ] don't expect changes when you haven't updated anything
- [ ] if something is broken then there's always a fix


----

## When you're creating a merge request:
### did you . . .
- [ ] rebase to the main branch?
